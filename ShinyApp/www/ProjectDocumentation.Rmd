### Data

Data source for the application can be obtained using the following code in R:

```{r datasource, eval=FALSE}
#### Download FRED data ####
if(!require(quantmod)) install.packages("quantmod")
require(quantmod)

# set tickers
tickers <- c("GDP", "W006RC1A027NBEA")

# import data from FRED database
getSymbols( tickers
            , src = "FRED"
            , adjust = TRUE
)

#Create Data Set
dtGDPtax <- data.table(Date = index(merge.xts(GDP, W006RC1A027NBEA, join = "inner")), merge.xts(GDP, W006RC1A027NBEA, join = "inner"))
names(dtGDPtax)[3] <- "TaxCollections"
dtGDPtax.percent <- dtGDPtax[,TaxPercentofGDP:=TaxCollections/(GDP)]
rownames(dtGDPtax.percent) = dtGDPtax.percent[,Date]
xtsGDPtax.percent <- as.xts(dtGDPtax.percent)

save(xtsGDPtax.percent, file = "GDPtaxpercent.RData")
